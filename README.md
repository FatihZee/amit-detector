# Amit-Detector

## About This Project

## Features
- **Word Detection**: Automatically detects the number of times the word "AMIT" is mentioned in a given comment.
- **Spam Filter**: Flags comments that contain the word "AMIT" more than a predefined threshold.
- **TikTok Integration**: Integrates with TikTok to automatically filter spam comments.
- **Frequency Count**: Displays how many times the word "AMIT" appears in a comment.
